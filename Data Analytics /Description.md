# 🫀 Heart Disease Risk Analytics: Insights & Prevention Guidelines

## 📌 Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are currently the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately **19.41 million deaths annually**. Despite being a major global health crisis, many of these cases are preventable through early detection and lifestyle management.

This project, developed as part of the **DS512/513 Data Analytics** course, focuses on analyzing the **Framingham Heart Study dataset**. Instead of solely relying on prediction, our primary goal is to derive actionable intelligence by identifying concrete **"Risk Indicators"**.

### 🎯 Project Objectives

The analysis aims to answer critical questions regarding heart disease risk factors through statistical analysis and visualization:

* **Analyze Risk Factors:** Identify key drivers of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk, including demographic (Age, Gender), behavioral (Smoking), and clinical factors (Glucose, BMI, Blood Pressure).
* **Visualize Insights:** Create interactive visualizations to clearly communicate risk patterns, such as the correlation between Glucose levels and Blood Pressure.
* **Develop Guidelines:** Use data-driven insights to propose preventive guidelines that promote healthier lifestyle behaviors.
* **Predictive Modeling (Secondary):** Develop a machine learning model to estimate 10-year CHD risk using techniques to handle class imbalance.

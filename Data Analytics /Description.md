# 🫀 Heart Disease Risk Analytics: Insights & Prevention Guidelines

## 📌 Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are currently the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately **19.41 million deaths annually**[cite: 15, 19, 56]. Despite being a major global health crisis, many of these cases are preventable through early detection and lifestyle management.

This project, developed as part of the **DS512/513 Data Analytics** course [cite: 5][cite_start], focuses on analyzing the **Framingham Heart Study dataset**[cite: 63, 83]. [cite_start]Instead of solely relying on prediction, our primary goal is to derive actionable intelligence by identifying concrete **"Risk Indicators"**[cite: 51].

### 🎯 Project Objectives

The analysis aims to answer critical questions regarding heart disease risk factors through statistical analysis and visualization:

* [cite_start]**Analyze Risk Factors:** Identify key drivers of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk, including demographic (Age, Gender), behavioral (Smoking), and clinical factors (Glucose, BMI, Blood Pressure)[cite: 63].
* [cite_start]**Visualize Insights:** Create interactive visualizations to clearly communicate risk patterns, such as the correlation between Glucose levels and Blood Pressure[cite: 66, 132].
* [cite_start]**Develop Guidelines:** Use data-driven insights to propose preventive guidelines that promote healthier lifestyle behaviors[cite: 64].
* [cite_start]**Predictive Modeling (Secondary):** Develop a machine learning model to estimate 10-year CHD risk using techniques to handle class imbalance[cite: 67].
